# Welcome Message by the Vice President Academics

A great leader Mr. Nelson Mandela said: "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."

SZABIST University has seen exponential growth in its programs, students, and physical infrastructure since its inception in 1995. This could be possible with the full support of its Management, especially of its worthy Chancellor, Dr. Azra Fazal Pechuho.

The whole purpose of education is to create "Analytical Minds". As a responsible institution, we just don't believe in classroom studies but believe in complete personality development. Our various students' societies are quite active, the purpose of which is to provide the students a platform to lead and learn to be a great team player by giving them opportunities to arrange different curricular and extra-curricular activities, which makes them good leaders globally competitive, morally upright, and well-rounded, disciplined individuals.

We at SZABIST University call our students our "Products" not our "customers" as we run our institution professionally not pure commercially. To facilitate the students getting internships, scholarships, and job placement, we have proper departments that regularly invite leading companies and students for "Recruitment Drives". We also periodically organize "Job Fairs" at our campus. Due to these efforts put in by our highly professional Faculty, 90% of graduates manage to get jobs within the first three months of their graduations.

SZABIST University now has six campuses in Karachi, Islamabad, Larkana, Hyderabad, Gharo, and Dubai. SZABIST University is the only Pakistani institution having its campus in Dubai International Academic City since 2003, competing with the world's leading institutions. Karachi campus is the mother campus having more than 8000 students enrolled in its 40-plus academic programs in Management Sciences, Computer Science, Social Sciences, Media Science, Life Sciences, Education, Mechatronic Engineering, and Law. Our three-year LLB program is offered in collaboration with the University of London.

SZABIST University programs comply with HEC recommended course plans and are accredited by regulatory bodies such as NBEAC, NCEAC, PEC, NACTE, and CIEC. The learning outcomes of the programs ensure to create critical & creative thinking, acquire problem-solving skills, and professionally handle all pedagogical tools. We are fully aware that a University without Research is like a "Body" without a "Soul"; therefore, we emphasize research activities at all levels of our programs.

Finally, I thank all the newcomers for choosing SZABIST University for their academic pursuits and wish them a happy stay during the entire period of their course of studies. I expect, as SZABISTian, you will show a high level of maturity through your conduct and actions.

# STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES

## Student Support Services

For more than a decade (2009-to date), the main SZABIST University campus has been fortunate to have a unique and diverse student body with a healthy record of activities and a proud history of achievements. Since 2014, with the establishment of the office of the student advisor, more organized and focused approach has been adopted with the aid of student advisory policies and guidelines for activities in the form of standard operating procedures and financial prudence guidelines with emphasis on paperwork and documentation/reports for record keeping all of which added much needed structure to student activities at the institute.

In 2015, the same system was gradually introduced at other campuses of SZABIST University and by now they have all had annually elected student council bodies.

## Vision of Student Support Services

We aim to provide students with a platform that allows them to conduct activities which work towards the development of a stronger, wiser and a more united student populace on campus. It works to inculcate in young minds the values of unity, tolerance, inclusion and leadership and through engagement with other campuses of SZABIST University and universities across the country realize the objectives of our core areas of focus, nation-ally as well.
